ESSAY RESPONSE
==============

To be honest, I don't have a lot of experience coding with mulitple languages.  I've only recently started working with computers since I've been
at college which has only been for a year and half now.  I've only mainly used **C++** and have never really realized its potential ability
unless you count using pointers.  Unforutunately, I don't have much to base my opinion about [Paul's thesis][Beating the Averages] that
> programming languages vary in power.

I will agree with him though when he states: 

> 1. that if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one.
 and
> 2. Blub paradox: they're satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs.

The first point makes sense but the problem is that he is talking about a startup where he can choose whatever language he wants because he is using his own server.
I doubt most people will create their own company and make their own rules.  Most will go work for a company that arbitrarily tells them which languages
they can program in and what they can program.  I imagine the company would not give the creative leeway Paul talks about.

The second point I believe is also true.  I'm used to programming in **C++** because that has been the language of choice of the professors for my previous classes.  Currently, I have 
another class in **Ruby** and that has completely blown my mind.  I had never heard of the idea that *"Everything is an object"* or that *"Functions were really methods
acting on objects"*.  The syntax is different and the way you think about how to do things within the language is  completely different.  For instance, the for loop in **C++**:
  
````c++
for (i = 1; i < 2; i++){
}
````
one of the main control/flow structures used in that language is is [not proper style][for] in **Ruby**.

I imagine that once you program in a certain language for a while, you don't want to use a different language.  You start to think within the constraints of that
language.  Thereby, limiting your ability to solve problems to the methods that that particular language allows.  I certainly believe that there are advantages and disadvantages to each language,
afterall why would there be so many in the first place if that was not the case.  I think being fluent in many different programming languages is important as it is important to be fluent in many spoken languages.
The reason being, there is no one universal language that everybody understands.
