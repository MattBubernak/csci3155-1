ESSAY RESPONSE
==============

To be honest, I don't have a lot of experience coding with mulitple languages.  I've only recently started working with computers since I've been
at college which has only been for a year and half now.  I've only mainly used **C++** and have never really realized its potential ability
unless you count using pointers.  Unforutunately, I don't have much to base my opinion about Paul's thesis that
> programming languages vary in power.

I will agree with him though when he states: 

> 1. that if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one.
 and
> 2. Blub paradox: they're satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs.

The first point makes sense but the problem is that he is talking about a startup where he can choose whatever language he wants because he is using his own server.
I doubt most people will create their own company and make their own rules.  Most will go work for a company that arbitrarily tells them which languages
they can program in and what they can program.  I imagine the company would not give the creative leeway Paul talks about.

The second point I believe is also true.  I'm used to programming an **C++** because that has been the language of choice for my previous classes.  I have 
another class in **Ruby** and that has completely blown my mind.  I had never heard of the idea that *"Everything is an object"* or that *"Functions were really methods
acting on objects"*.
