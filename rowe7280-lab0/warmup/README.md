I started by looking at the example of `FlatSpec` provided in the write-up.
I copied that into test and after asking on piazza I figured out how to run it.
Besides that, I looked at the documentation of `FlatSpec` and how to use certain verbs to create the tests.
Then, I stepped through the exercises with assistance from the provided solutions from AtomicScala.
After I completed all the tests I had to move all the methods declarations into the `Warmup.scala` file.
I stumbled upon Jed's repo and found examples on how to do this eventually completing to the best of my 
knowlegde everything that was required of me in the warmup.
