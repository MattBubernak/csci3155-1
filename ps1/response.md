Why has **Javascript** been so successful?  And by successful I mean, why is it so popular with a lot of people.  The answer from Douglas Crockford is that it's ["popularity is due entirely to its role as the scripting language of the WWW."][Analysis]  I would have to agree with him and based on the reading I did **Javascript** was barely lucky enought to be kept around.

In the beginning there was *Netscape* and they had a man working for them by the name of *Brendan Eich*.  Crawford identified him as the single designer of [**Javascript**][Popular].  He wrote **Javascript** and *Netscape* implemented it in their browser.  Eventually, *Microsoft* "reverse engineered Netscape's Language" in order to catch up to *Netscape* in the browser wars.  Other people followed suit and **Javascript** proliferated as the main language of most of the early, popular browsers.

There are few issues with **Javascript** and one of them is that it was rushed to the production stage and wasn't vetted properly.  People have solved some of **Javascript**'s shortcomings by using libraries such as *Ajax* or *jQuery*.  Another problem is **Javascript** is thought to be like **Java** because it contains **Java** in its name but indeed **Javascript** and **Java** are not significantly related.  This has, although, turned many people off.  **Javascript** also ["has it's share of design errors"][Analysis] and bad books written about it that don't help its cause but cause confusion about the language.  Crawford says one of **Javascript**'s problems is that it is associated with being the language "strictly for the amateurs" giving it a bad reputation.   

But despite it's issues, the man who created *jQuery*, a **Javascript** library, John Resig, says he wants to teach students ["Javascript as their first language."][ejohn] Resig states that this is 
>"largely due to its ubiquity, desirability in the larger workforce, lack of prior installation requirements, and ability to create something thatâ€™s easy to share with friends."

Again, popularity is mentioned as one of the reasons why **Javascript** has not become obsolete.  Because a lot of the earlier web browsers were adopted in **Javascript**'s image, one would be hard up to change the "language of the WWW."  Just like any idea, that is adopted and the consensus among the majority of people is to embrace it, it can only be usurped by revolutoin and no revolution has yet to get rid of **Javascript**.  That is the main reason why **Javascript** has remained popular, because there is no overwelming force to overthrow it.
