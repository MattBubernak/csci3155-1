For **Comprehensions** on pg. 181, I learned how to use a `for` loop to iterate through objects.  In addition, I used `yield` to return an object instead of declaring a `val` to do so.  I also iterated through a case class with multiple parts, accessing each one individually to do matching in order to return the appropriate values.

For **Functions as Objects** on pg. 170-171, I learned how to create anonymous functions by simplifying the syntax of the function and using the "rocket" operator.  I made an anonymous function with mulitple arguments and one that produced the simple plural of an argument by appending to a `var`.  I also saw how `foreach` can be used to go through each value of an object to do some sort of modification to each one.

For **Map&Reduce** on pg.174-175, I learned how to use `map` and `reduce` to do arithmetic on objects.  I saw that when using `map` you are less likely to make mistakes than if you used `for` or `foreach` and the code is much more concise in that regard.

For **Brevity** on pg. 197, I learned about being able to remove curly braces, return types, and intermediate results to make the code shorter.  I also learned you can condense code into 1 line using semicolons.  And that in some cases one can omit arguments in a function and scala with still know what you are talking about.

For **Combining Sequences with zip** on pg. 305, I learned how to combine two lists or vectors into mulitple tuples using the `zip` method.
